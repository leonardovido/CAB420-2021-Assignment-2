This research aims to develop machine learning models that can accurately identify speakers with different accents by using different voice features and machine learning methods. For this project we used three different machine learning techniques: K-Neighbours, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to determine accents.
